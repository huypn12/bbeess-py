\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\thispagestyle{empty}

First and foremost, I would like to express its gratitude and appreciation to my supervisor
Prof.Dr. Tatjana Petrov. Without her motivation, advice, supports, and feedback on my implementation
and writing, this thesis would be far from being done.\\

\noindent Working in the research group MCSS (modeling of complex, self-organising systems) is an excellent
experience. I would like to thank the members of MCSS group, Matej Hajnal, Stefano Tognazzi, and
Denis Repin for their nice discussions and feedback on the technical and theoretical aspects of my
work.\\

\noindent My deep gratitude goes to my family. Despite of being thousands of kilometers away, they are
always the best source of support and encouragement. A special thank is for Lu Dinh, for her
endless love and encouragement.\\
