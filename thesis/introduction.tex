\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}

Markov population model is widely used in modeling several systems, for example
\begin{itemize}
      \item Number of online nodes in a distributed system.
      \item Number of surviving individuals in an epidemic model.
\end{itemize}

A limit of Markov population models, such as Discrete-time Markov chain, is that all transition probabilities are known a-priori. In order to formalize unknown attributes of a system, we introduce parameter, hence we have parametric Markov population models. In this thesis, we work with parametric discrete-time Markov chain, specifically data-driven parameter synthesis for problem on discrete-time Markov chain.\\

Parameter synthesis is an emerging research direction on probabilistic model checking. Parameter synthesis problem is to find a set of parameter values to satisfy a certain reachability property \cite{katoen2016probabilistic}. The question this thesis answers is that, given a parametric discrete-time



\section{Contribution}
This thesis surveys the parameter synthesis of discrete time markov population model towards a certain property.
We model a system discrete time model of a system.
