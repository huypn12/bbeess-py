\chapter{Introduction}
In different areas of research and application, the objects are to study how the number of
individuals in a closed environment develop under a certain set of assumptions. For instance
\begin{itemize}
      \item Number of online nodes in a distributed system.
      \item Number of surviving individuals in an epidemic model.
\end{itemize}
Markov population models \cite{kingman1969markov} are finite state-space, stochastic models that is
widely used in modeling complex and dynamic systems. In a Markov population model, each state
represents the number of individuals. Formally, in a Markov population model whose state space is
$S=(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$, there is a map $f:S\rightarrow\{0,\ldots,N\}$ where $N\in\mathbf{N}^*$ is the
maximum number of individuals in the system.\\
In a Markov population models, for example Discrete-time Markov Chain, initial and transition
probabilities are known a-priori. In order to encompass unknown attributes of a system, we introduce
\textit{parametric Markov population models}. In a parametric Markov population model, each
transition is a rational function of parameters. As unknown features of the system are represented
by parameters, the following research questions are raised
\begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{Parameter inference:} Given a set of data collected by observing the system, how
            can we know about its parameters?
      \item \textit{Parameter synthesis:} Which values of parameters instantiate a model that
            satisfies a certain bounded reachability property of interest?
\end{itemize}
In this thesis, we presents data-driven frameworks for parameter synthesis of parametric
Discrete-time Markov Chain. Parameter synthesis is an emerging research direction on probabilistic
model checking. Parameter synthesis problem is to find a set of parameter values to satisfy a
certain reachability property \cite{katoen2016probabilistic}. Contributions of the thesis are
\begin{itemize}
      \item Proposing and implementing a data-driven frameworks on parameter synthesis of parametric
            Discrete-time Markov Chain.
      \item Evaluating the scalability of the frameworks with different sizes of model state-space.
      \item Comparing the performances of optimization methods used to approximate posterior
            distribution in cases of closed-form solution available and simulation.
\end{itemize}
