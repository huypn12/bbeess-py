\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}

Markov population model.

In order to incorporate unknown features of the system, we introduce \textit{parametric models}. Parameter synthesis is a relatively new research area \cite{katoen2016probabilistic}

This thesis is structured as follow.

\section{Structure of the thesis}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Chapter 1} introduces motivations and background for the research topic.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 2} describes the most important definitions and
        theoretical background. In this chapter, we defines Discrete-Time Markov Chain
        formally. A brief introduction to Bayesian Inference is also included.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 3} reviews the state-of-the-art works of other researchers
        on the problem of parameter synthesis.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 4} describes the method.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 5} describes the benchmark.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 6} conclusion and future work.
\end{itemize}
