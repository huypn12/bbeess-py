\cite{kwiatkowska2011prism}

The definition and model checking of DTMC and pMC is studied by \cite{baier2008principles},
\cite{hutschenreiter2017parametric}, and \cite{katoen2016probabilistic}.\\
Bayesian inference of pMC parameters is studied in \cite{polgreen2016data} and
. In , the authors developed methods to synthesize
parameters to satisfy a given set of PCTL properties. In \cite{jha2009bayesian}, the authors
presented methods to perform model checking of biological system using Bayesian statistic. The
authors in \cite{jha2009bayesian} uses a Bayesian hypothesis test, where $H_0$ is the null
hypothesis that the model satisfies a PCTL $P$, and alternative hypothesis $H_1$ is that the system
does not satisfies $P$. Similar approach to the parameter estimation in this project is described by
\cite{hussain2015automated}.\\
In this project, we use bee colony model semantics from \cite{hajnal2019data}. The methods and
implementation in this project is designed to extend the results of \cite{hajnal2019data} and its
tool \textit{DiPS}

storm drawback: it does not support

%% CITE some comparision between storm and prism

In \cite{molyneux2020abc} the author introduces the same approach but it is to use on CSL properties
and CTMC.
