%% Probabilistic model checking and parameter synthesis
The current research progress on probabilistic model checking is studied thoroughly by Katoen and Baier et al \cite{baier2008principles}. Katoen et al. \cite{katoen2016probabilistic} briefly summarized important aspect of probabilistic model checking.

%% Bayesian verification
Polgreen et al \cite{polgreen2016data} presents a method for bayesian inference of pMC parameters in

%% Tools: PRISM and STORM

The definition and model checking of DTMC and pMC is studied by
\cite{baier2008principles}, \cite{hutschenreiter2017parametric}, and \cite{katoen2016probabilistic}.\\
Bayesian inference of pMC parameters is studied in \cite{polgreen2016data} and
\cite{jha2009bayesian}. In \cite{polgreen2016data}, the authors developed
methods to synthesize parameters to satisfy a given set of PCTL properties. In
\cite{jha2009bayesian}, the authors presented methods to perform model checking
of biological system using Bayesian statistic. The authors in
\cite{jha2009bayesian} uses a Bayesian hypothesis test, where $H_0$ is the null
hypothesis that the model satisfies a PCTL $P$, and alternative hypothesis $H_1$
is that the system does not satisfies $P$. Similar approach to the parameter
estimation in this project is described by \cite{hussain2015automated}.\\
In this project, we use bee colony model semantics from \cite{hajnal2019data}.
The methods and implementation in this project is designed to extend the results
of \cite{hajnal2019data} and its tool \textit{DiPS}

storm drawback: it does not support discrete event simulation

In \cite{molyneux2020abc} the author introduces the same approach but it is to use on CSL properties and CTMC.
