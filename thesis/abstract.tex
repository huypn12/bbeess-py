    We present frameworks for data-informed parameter synthesis of Markov population processes.
    Given statistics data of the population at its steady-state, the object is to synthesize a set
    of parameters so that a temporal property of interest is satisfied. We design Bayesian
    frameworks for parameter synthesis in both cases: when the closed form of the interested
    property is obtainable, and when only simulation is possible. The frameworks are constructed
    with different sampling and optimization techniques to approximate the posterior distribution.
    Later, we evaluate the frameworks using different population models of different size using
    synthetic data generated from a known true parameter. By measuring the distance between
    synthesized parameters and true parameters and visualize sampled parameter values with their
    corresponding weights, we show that our frameworks are capable of deriving a set of satisfying
    parameter values, as well as an estimation which is close to the true parameter.
