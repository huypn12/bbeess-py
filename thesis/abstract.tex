    Population models are mathematical models to study the dynamics of a population. Markov
    population processes are Markov chains of continuous or discrete time, in which each state
    represents a vector of population size. We present a frameworkS for data-informed parameter
    synthesis of parametric Markov population processes. Given experimental data for the population
    at its steady-state, parameter synthesis aims to find a set of parameters to satisfy a temporal
    property of interest. We design a Bayesian framework for parameter synthesis in two cases: (i)
    when the exact likelihood function of the property of interest is available, and (ii) when it
    has to be approximated by means of Monte-Carlo methods. The frameworks are constructed with
    different sampling and optimization techniques to approximate the posterior distribution. We
    evaluate the frameworks using various population models of different sizes using synthetic data
    generated from a known true parameter. By measuring the distance between estimated parameters
    and true parameters and visualize synthesized parameter values with their corresponding weights,
    we show that our frameworks can derive a set of satisfying parameter values and an estimation
    that is close to the true parameter.
