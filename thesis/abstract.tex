\begin{abstract}
    We present frameworks for data-informed parameter synthesis of Markov population processes.
    Given a parametric discrete-time Markov population model and a temporal property of interest, we
    synthesize a set of parameter values, of which the instantiated models are high probably
    generate a set of steady state data. Later, we evaluate the frameworks using different
    population models of different size using synthetic data generated from a known true parameter.
    We show that our frameworks are capable of deriving a set of satisfying parameter values, as
    well as an estimation which is close to the true parameter.
