    We present frameworks for data-informed parameter synthesis of Markov population processes.
    Based on statistics data of the population at its steady-state, we synthesize a set of
    parameters so that a temporal property of interest is satisfied. The frameworks are constructed
    from a Bayesian approach towards the observed steady-state data, using several different
    sampling and optimization techniques to approximate the posterior distribution.  Later, we
    evaluate the frameworks using different population models of different size using synthetic data
    generated from a known true parameter. By measuring the distance between synthesized parameters
    and true parameters and visualize sampled parameter values with their corresponding weights, we
    show that our frameworks are capable of deriving a set of satisfying parameter values, as well
    as an estimation which is close to the true parameter.
