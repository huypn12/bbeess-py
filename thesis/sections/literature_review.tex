\section{Probabilistic model checking}
%% Model checking of labelled dtmc

\section{Parameter synthesis}
%% Parameter lifting

\section{Bayesian model checking}
In the paper (Polgreen), the authors proposed an algorithm to decompose 

%% Jha
In the paper (Jha) \cite{}, the authors proposed an algorithm to statistically check
for (PB)LTL properties.
The advantage of the algorithm is that 
The disadvantage of the algorithm is that it does 



\section{Tool}
%% Symbolic model checking: PRISM

%% Symbolic model checking with factorization of rational function: STORM
