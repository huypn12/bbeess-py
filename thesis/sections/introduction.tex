We study the parameter synthesis problem of parametric Discrete-Time Markov
Chain. Markov Chain is a probabilistic model to formalize stochastic
processes. 

This thesis is structured as follow.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chapter 1} states the parameter synthesis problem and its applications.
\item \textbf{Chapter 2} describes the most important definitions and
  theoretical background. In this chapter, we defines Discrete-Time Markov Chain
  formally. A brief introduction to Bayesian Inference is also included.
\item \textbf{Chapter 3} reviews the state-of-the-art works of other researchers
  on the problem of parameter synthesis.
