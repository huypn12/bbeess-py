In the paper (Jha) \cite{}, the authors proposed an algorithm to statistically check
for (PB)LTL properties.
The advantage of the algorithm is that
The disadvantage of the algorithm is that it does

The definition and model checking of DTMC and pMC is studied by
\cite{baier2008principles}, \cite{hutschenreiter2017parametric}, and \cite{katoen2016probabilistic}.\\
Bayesian inference of pMC parameters is studied in \cite{polgreen2016data} and
\cite{jha2009bayesian}. In \cite{polgreen2016data}, the authors developed
methods to synthesize parameters to satisfy a given set of PCTL properties. In
\cite{jha2009bayesian}, the authors presented methods to perform model checking
of biological system using Bayesian statistic. The authors in
\cite{jha2009bayesian} uses a Bayesian hypothesis test, where $H_0$ is the null
hypothesis that the model satisfies a PCTL $P$, and alternative hypothesis $H_1$
is that the system does not satisfies $P$. Similar approach to the parameter
estimation in this project is described by \cite{hussain2015automated}.\\
In this project, we use bee colony model semantics from \cite{hajnal2019data}.
The methods and implementation in this project is designed to extend the results
of \cite{hajnal2019data} and its tool \textit{DiPS}.
